# OpenBooks WebApp Backend Migration

## Introduction

This repository documents the ongoing backend migration of the OpenBooks WebApp from Node.js to Gin, a Golang web framework. This transition is aimed at improving the performance, scalability, and maintainability of our application.

## Motivation

The decision to migrate from Node.js to Gin is driven by several factors:

1. **Performance**: Gin is known for its speed and efficiency, which will lead to faster response times and a more responsive user experience.

3. **Maintenance**: Golang's simplicity and strict typing provide greater code stability and ease of maintenance.

4. **Community Support**: Gin has a strong community with active development and a rich ecosystem of plugins and middleware.

## Ongoing Progress

We are currently in the midst of the migration process. The following tasks have been completed or are in progress:

- [x] Initial project setup with Gin.
- [x] Rewriting API endpoints and routes.
- [x] Database migration and data transfer.
- [x] Integration of essential middleware and services.
- [ ] Testing and quality assurance.

## How to Contribute

If you would like to contribute to this migration or have suggestions, feel free to open issues or submit pull requests. Your input is highly valued and can help ensure a successful transition.

## Getting Started

Once the migration is complete, we will provide updated instructions for running and deploying the OpenBooks WebApp with the Gin backend.
